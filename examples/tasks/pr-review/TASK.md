Use the provider API to read the pull request's changed files
(`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/{number}/files`), then read related code if you need context.

Submit one review with event `comment`: a two-sentence summary of the change, then at most three
concrete observations (bugs, missing tests, or unclear code), each naming the file. Do not approve or
request changes, and skip style nits. Then finish.
