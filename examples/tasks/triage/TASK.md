Triage the issue that triggered this run.

1. Use the provider API to list the repository's labels (`GET /repos/{owner}/{repo}/labels`) and to
   search for similar open issues (`GET /search/issues` with `q=repo:{owner}/{repo} is:issue
   is:open` plus two or three key words from the title).
2. Read repository files only if the issue is about specific code.
3. Propose `issue.comment.create`: at most 80 words, summarising the problem and the likely area of
   the code. If any open issue looks like a duplicate, link it. Do not promise a fix.
4. Propose `issue.label.add` for at most two labels that already exist and clearly fit. Skip this
   step if none fit; never invent a label.

Then finish.
